## Sequences
	Sequence is an ordered list of terms which follows a certain ratio. 
- arithmetic sequences: common difference
- geometric sequences: common ratio
## Recursive Rule
Each turn is based on the previous terms
	$u_n=u_{n-1}+d$
## Deductive Rule
Each term is based on its position in the sequence. (n)
	$u_n=a+d(n-1)$
