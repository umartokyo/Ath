Scalars vs Vectors:
- Scalars: consists of magnitude.
- Vectors: consists of both magnitude and direction.
## Vector Operations
Scalar Multiplication:
$$a*\vec{B}=a\vec{B}$$
Vector Addition:
$$\vec{A}+\vec{B}$$
Length and director of two perpendicular vectors:
$$C_{length}=\vec{A}^2+\vec{B}^2$$
$$C_{direction}=tan^{-1}\frac{B}{A}$$
## Resolving a Vector
The operation of separating a vector into its components by axis is referred to as 'resolving' a vector, and is a reverse process of vector addition. Solving for the components of $\vec{A}$, we get:
$$A_x=Acos(\theta), A_y=Asin(\theta)$$
