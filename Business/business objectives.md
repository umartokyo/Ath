## Vision and Mission
Vision and Mission statements play a big role in this. Effective organizations need to know why they do what they do. This is essential to motivation.
**Vision**: The 'why' of an organization provides a focal point around which everyone in an organization can orient themselves. This should be a big dream you should be striving for.
**Mission**: A clear understanding of the 'why' is also important for employees to feel personal purpose their work. Short term operations we take to achieve that vision.

Vision and mission are critical for everyday orientation in business. It helps employees to keep long-term goals and dreams in mind as they work through their operations. Serves as a central point of reference. Important during crises or turning points, when the company has a major challenge to tackle or decision to make. Both evolve over time, but changes are usually made only after serious reflection and discussion.

Vision and mission statements must be carefully worded and taken seriously by senior management. Furthermore, they are read by interested parties outside the organization, in order to understand the organization's purpose and priorities.
