People who start businesses are known as entrepreneurs.
We differentiate business starters and entrepreneurs by risk they're taking by this action.

Entrepreneurs (aka changemakers) often say that starting a business is one of the most exciting and interesting things they have ever done. There are serial entrepreneurs who start businesses, grow them, sell them and are happy about it.

Entrepreneur's work is:
- Understanding communities and their problems.
- Designing and planning solutions.
- Taking action.
- Sharing and growing actions to increase impact.
(Ex: People who support other people's startup businesses; Keep on making businesses and giving them to others)

> Intrapreneur: Manager within a company who promotes innovative product development and marketing. (ones who develop creative ideas within the company.)

Entrepreneurial mindset, skillset can be used within wide range of environment.
