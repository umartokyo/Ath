This 'embedded economy model 'is a [[business model]] of our society. Because the earth and society and economy are interconnected they stay within each other in the graph. 

Embeddings of earth, society and economy inside one another is important; it shows our complete dependency on the resources from the Earth. Inner parts are dependent on their outer counterparts.

Centre of the model shoes different types of human systems for distributing goods and services:
- **Households**: care services between people with closer relationships; goods and services are unpaid. (dish washing, daily food)
- **State**: basic human needs and goods are made accessible for everyone; funded through taxes or available at a very low price. (education, roads...)
- **Commons**: provision of shared assets and services by society or natural resources; free. (wikipedia, open source initiative, public libraries funded by volunteers...)
- **Markets**: provides goods and services by businesses; exchanged for money or other resources in some cases. (food, restaurants...)

In this course, we mainly focus on the **markets** and **states**.
