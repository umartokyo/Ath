In order to analyze internal factors, we've used four business functions;
Human Resources | Marketing | Finance | Management
A business has a good chance of success when:
- There's a skilled and collaborative team of employees in place
- There's enough funding to run the business
- The marketing has been researched well
- The operations are efficient and resilient

Business is a part of a system, so whatever is happening in the external environment will affect our business as well. As we don't have any control over the external environment, whatever happens in external environment will affect all the businesses within, meaning it will affect both you and your competitors. 

> Opportunities: Everything what's happening externally which can favor our business. (competitor going bankrupt, covid-like examples when you're a digital company, international agreements)

As a businessman, you're goal is turning opportunities into benefits.

> Threats: Any unfavorable external condition or trend that harms the business. (ban of your company within the market you operate, being replaced by a big business, new agreements on limiting oil CO2 emissions.)

Exam tip: when we're discussing opportunities, we're only discussing the external factors. Ex: if you're capable of producing the new product it's strength, not opportunity. Opportunity is an external condition which is favorable for the business.
