Social enterprise is any organization that has a social and environmental purpose as its core. Note that they are different from NPO's. 
For-profit social enterprise describes primary purpose of a business, not it's official business form.

For-profit social enterprises are hybrid organizations that combine the best of private and public sectors. 

A for-profit social enterprise is a revenue and profit-making business. It integrates social and/or environmental impact directly into its business model.

If social enterprise is paying above average wages, working to regenerate nature through its operations or exceeding other social responsibilities, its production costs could be higher, which could again reduce profits. Thus positive social impact is maximized.

Unlike many for-profit commercial enterprises, for profit social enterprises are judged less on their profits and more on their multi-stakeholder impact.
Most profits are reinvested in the business but some can be distributed among shareholders.

3 Types of for-profit social enterprises:
- Private sector for-profit enterprise
- Public sector for-profit enterprise
- Cooperatives

Public:
With their help, governments may be able to lower their costs and focus on other areas of public services.
Governments must maintain some oversight to ensure that the service is being carried out as expected.

Cooperatives:
Type of business that is owned by its members. 
You can think of it as a group project where every person works on own part and you are still a part of a whole and responsible for the project.
Members run the organizations in their common interest, using democratic governance.
All members participate in decision-making either directly by voting on important decisions or through representation.
Cooperatives typically have limited liability.

Limited liability: personal assets of shareholder are protected.

Cooperatives can be classified either by: type of industry or who owns and runs them.
Ex:
- Agriculture
- Insurance
- Wholesale and retail
- Housing
- Health care
- Education
- Utilities
- Banking
- Wholesale and retail trade

Cooperatives Example: Agriculture
- To negotiate lower prices on inputs such as fertilizer and seeds by buying in bulk, or by buying expensive equipment together to share.
- They can also negotiate higher prices for their outputs by working together to equalize power with large grocery retailers.
- Stronger within a group.
- They have a common interests and goals to work towards.

Evaluation of for-profit social enterprises
- Funding: Longer returns (patient capital), or lower returns.
- Credibility: There may be distrust of the business from a wide range of people. (Risk of social washing or green washing)
- Measuring impact: Measuring social or environmental impact is more difficult. (Qualitative)
- Managing complex supply chains.
- Remaining true to purpose.
