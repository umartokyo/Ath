> The business of business is business

If main purpose is maximizing profits, it prioritizes value for shareholders. Doing this involves objectives focused on growth. When a business grows, it can increase its revenue and reduce its unit (average) cost of production, resulting in increased profits. 

But, it wasn't considered that there's a desirable and necessary profit, which is the bare minimum needed for business to operate and sustain itself. However, excessive focus on growth and profit can also result in damages to the environment and society: Excessive value extraction.

With excessive value extraction, one group of stakeholders captures for itself a very large portion of the value created by the business.
- Stakeholders take very large profits
- Paying workers below the living wage
- Limiting reinvestments
- Cutting costs by using processes that damage the environment
