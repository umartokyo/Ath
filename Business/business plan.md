> Business plan is a tool used to describe a business. 

Both for a new businesses, or an existing business that is making a large change. You have to put all the details of the business you're creating including. Business plan is important for a business to think through the key aspects of its operations. It will help people to believe in the entrepreneur, reduce risk and inspire others to join us. It must consider its purpose and audience. It is very likely that an entrepreneur will have several business plans that can be used for different situations. There is no standard format: the purpose will determine the format.

Starting from writing a business plan on a tissue, it will grow to be more formal as the entrepreneur seeks partners, funding, market recognition and attempts to grow ideas.

Business plan must consider its purpose and audience, it is very likely that an entrepreneur will have multiple versions of the business plan to be used for different situations. (money-wise version for banks, tech stuff for engineers and innovation part for researchers.)

> A business plan is a story, supported by evidence.

Narrative Bias
Throughout history, we as humans connect to stories. Story is a mental shortcut, which makes sense of a complex world and connect to the stakeholder. If you'll treat people as machines, they'll feel disconnected and leave you. 

Heuristics: Involving or enabling discovery or problem-solving through methods such as experimentation, evaluation, and trial and error.

Elements of a business plan: Golden Circle
1. Why?
2. How?
3. What?

Human beings make decisions using intuition but they justify their decisions based on evidence and data. That's why together with story, evidence must be given to the story. Business must prove that it will be successful. 

**Secondary research**: (aka desk research) involves using evidence gathered by others. This information can be found in news articles, research journals, company and market reports and other reliable resources. You're telling to the stakeholders that your words are real and outside sources support your conclusion.

**Primary research**: it is advised to have it yet can be neglected some times. You're collecting own data through surveys, interviews, observations, focus groups or other methods. 
	Forms of evidence data: Interview: Qualitative; Survey: Quantitative.
