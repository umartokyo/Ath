Businesses are systems consisting of 4 main systems which are discussed in this document.
## Inputs
Resources needed to create a product. (physical, financial, human)

**Physical Recourses**: row materials and semi-finished goods needed to produce the product.
- Raw / Semi-finished goods are the materials used for creation of the final product.
- Capital goods are tools / machines used for creating the final product.
**Financial Resources**: funds needed to set up and keep business running.
- Long-term financing can be used for bigger purchases over the longer period of time.
- Short-term financing are one-time payments business make which include electricity, salaries...
**Human recourses**: the people needed for business to function.
- Enterprise is the act of taking the risks to combine other resources to create a good or service?

In IBDP, we divide resources into these categories: Land, Labour, Capital, Enterpreneurship
## Processes 
Aka business functions. Managing inputs to create outputs. (varies on input and the type of business) Here are some general ones:

**Human resource management**: making sure business has enough skilled employees to produce and deliver its goods. Checking on their health.
**Finance and accounts**: making sure business has enough money to function properly over time.
**Marketing**: advertising and selling the product to the right customer at a right price. 
**Operations**: plan the details of the production of goods and services.
## Outputs
Goods and Services;
- **Goods**: tangible objects.
- **Service**: intangible.

Often goods and services are mixed like in restaurants or stores, where they both cell you a product and service you in some way or another. Keep in mind that business management is a model.
## Feedback
Usually occurs when the output of a system is somehow linked to its input.

- **Negative feedback**: helps keeping system stable and make improvements to the product or organization.
- **Positive feedback**: reinforcing; sometimes might result a loss of the product quality, sometimes helps understand strength of the product.
