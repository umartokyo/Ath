Businesses are systems consisting of 4 main systems which are discussed in this document.
## Inputs
Resources needed to create a product. (physical, financial, human)

**Physical Recourses**: row materials and semi-finished goods needed to produce the product.
- Raw / Semi-finished goods are the materials used for creation of the final product.
- Capital goods are tools / machines, buildings used for creating the final product and sustain the development of business.
**Financial Resources**: funds needed to set up and keep business running.
- Medium, Long-term financing can be used for bigger purchases over the longer period of time. Long term: Within 5-15 years, monthly allocations, more involved and extensive.
- Short-term financing (funds) are one-time payments business make which include electricity, salaries... Within year, daily-weekly allocations, less complex.
**Human recourses**: the people needed for business to function.
- People: Managers, employees.

- Enterprise is the act of taking the risks to combine other resources to create a good or service?
	Entrepreneur - someone who takes risks to create a better resource.
	Factor of taking risk to take a business is called an enterprise.
In IBDP, we divide resources into these categories: Land, Labour, Capital, Entrepreneurship.
## Processes 
Aka business functions. Managing inputs to create outputs. (varies on input and the type of business) Here are some general ones:

**Human resource management**: making sure business has enough (quantity) skilled (quality) employees to produce and deliver its goods. Ensure checking on their health and if they are treated ethically.
**Finance and accounts**: managing money, making sure business has enough money to function properly over time.
**Marketing**: advertising and selling the product to the right customer on a right time at a right price. 
**Operations**: plan the details of the production of goods and services. Everything which goes towards physical functionality of the business. (first place of reaction if something goes wrong with the company.) (like Alfred for Batman.)
## Outputs
Goods and Services;
- **Goods**: if an ownership of a product is transferred to you; mostly tangible objects.
- **Service**: "insert term", are not intangible.
	"Cashier, good or service? Its just one so please say the correct one" - Mr.Emin
	"Give us an unseen example as IB likes to say" - Mr.Emin

Often goods and services are mixed like in restaurants or stores, where they both cell you a product and service you in some way or another. Keep in mind that business management is a model.
## Feedback
Usually occurs when the output of a system is somehow linked to its input.
**Negative feedback**: helps keeping system stable and make improvements to the product or organization.
	Negative feedback look: **balancing act / balance restoring effect**; 
	Body temperature rises -> We sweat -> We cool off -> If an infection happens / heat accumulates in the body -> Body Temperature rises. (At the end we come back to normal temperature so the balance is restored.)
**Positive feedback**: reinforcing; sometimes might result a loss of the product quality, sometimes helps understand strength of the product.
	Positive feedback loop: **amplifying effect**;
	Example: Heat rises -> Ice melts -> Less reflective surfaces. -> More radiation absorbed -> Heat rises (amplified effect, keeps going up.)

"Did you dislocate your shoulder?" - Mr.Emin
## Furthermore
Notice that this model works in all businesses no matter how small or big it is. However, in large businesses each of these sectors can be subdivided into smaller ones.
### How to survive and thrive as business
The rapid change in the external environment caused by pandemic required businesses to be creative, consider new questions of ethics and find ways to achieve sustainability
	With flexibility comes resilience

You need to be consistent with all the customers to gain trust and support during bad times
