Foundation
	The word economics comes from Greek philosopher Xenophon.
	It combines oikos (household) with nomos (rules or norms).

Nowadays, we use the word economy to refer to a system for producing and distributing goods and services among a group of people. Businesses are a part of that system. Main purpose of economy: provide basic human needs.
