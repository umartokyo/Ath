## Reasons to start a new business:
- It all starts with the **new business idea**: most popular image of entrepreneurs. 
- **Passion to make change**: comes with a powerful sense of purpose and motivation.
(These two are traits of serial entrepreneurs as they have all the passion within these steps.)
- **Marked need**: fulfilling the needs of a group of people.
- **Earning a living**: simply to make money for themselves and their families.
- **Greater financial reward**: talent + own business (can) = earn more money.
- **Control**: control over their work or their future plans.
- **Work-life balance**: a better balance between work and their private life; own working hours, projects, locations.

Often, starting a business is more about necessity than choice. In many countries, people are out of jobs and within bad financial situations, which might require some risk.
## Challenges of starting a new business:
- **Lack of funds**: underestimations of the amounts necessary to sustain operations. (usually the most common problem.)
- **Strong competition**: difficult to break into existing markets.
Buyout: when bigger companies go to search of smaller companies in order of obtaining them.
- **Market too small / no market**: some entrepreneurs are too focused on the product.
- **Unskilled employees or lack of collaboration**: potential employees do not like the risk.
- **Poor management skills**: experts in their fields, less skilled at management.
- **Economic, environmental or political shocks**: less resilient.
