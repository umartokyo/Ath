> Entity: a thing with distinct and independent existence

Types of business entities:

- Your course
- Where you want to study
- You want private or public university
	- Why?
		- Public universities are usually owned by governments -> may cost low. Tuition feels may be very low for international students too. In countries like China, locals can get free education. Nothing is free so, free education comes from taxes. In states, many public universities are owned by individual states, so the fees for local residents might be lower. In UK, public universities are independent. They are not owned by the government but they do receive government funding; rest of the income comes from tuition fees.
		- UK also has some private universities, meaning all of the income comes from tuition fees. Number of private universities have grown recently. Most of the private universities are non-profit organizations: all money school gains is invested back to school. (NPO's) All the remaining profit money will be re-invested into institution. Non-profit organizations are also allowed to receive donations, which provides funds (endowments) worth billions of dollars. For example. NYU expanded to Abu-Dabi and Shanghai. 
		- Other private universities are for-profit organizations. (FPO's) Unlike NPO's, universities do not reinvest money back into the university; instead the leftover money is distributed among shareholders. While it makes it attractive for private investors, the profit objective may change the way the education institution operates and how it produces and distributes value in organization. 

> Dilemma: when you start prioritize profits, you're less likely to prioritize accessibility and quality of education.

> Non-profit organizations (NPO's)
> Endowment: donation of money or property to a nonprofit organization usually done by alumni.

## Distinction between private and pubic sectors
Businesses in the private sector are owned and controlled by private individuals. Decisions about businesses are taken by its owners, the government rarely takes part in decision-making. They can be small businesses, owned and run by one person like family restaurants. They can also be huge multinational companies operating globally and run by shareholders like big automobile corporations. Private sector provides goods and services at a market price. The business provides profit for their owners. These good and services can only be accessed by people who are willing and able to buy these products.
