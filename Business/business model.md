> Models are simplified versions of reality.

We often use models to understand the world through a simplified representation of structures, relationships, or processes. Models simplify reality. Remember that models do not show every part and process of the action situation. Models include only relevant components and processes.

Algorithms, simulations, text descriptions of structures, relationships and processes can be used in more complex models.

**Limitations**:
All models are flawed due to their initial design and purpose:  they are constructed by humans and are simplifications of reality.

**Uses**:
- Understanding most important components and processes in a complex situation.
- Making predictions of the future.
- Transfer understandings from one area to another.
- Recognize patterns in the world.
- Test processes and outcomes under different conditions.
- Communicate ideas.

	In economics, experts disagree about how to model an economy. 
In a process of simplification, creator of the model includes and excludes what he/she think is right which is different from what other experts would choose.

Model examples:
- [[two-sector circular flow model]]
- [[five-sector circular flow model]]
- [[embedded economy model]] (the one we'll be using through ib dp course)
- [[doughnut economics model]]
