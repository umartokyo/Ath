Perceptron is a simplest type of artificial [[neuron]]. Developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, it's a linear binary classifier, which forms a foundation for more complex neural network architectures. 
Perceptron differs from modern [[neuron]] with the activation function. Neuron uses continuous [[activation function]]s, while perceptron uses [[step function]]. 
## Capabilities and Limitation
- Can solve linearly separable problems like AND, OR.
- Cannot solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR.
- This limitation led to the first AI winter but also to the development of multi-layer networks, and [[multi-layer perceptron, MLP]] in particular.
