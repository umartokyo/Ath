Regression is a type of [[supervised learning]] algorithm which predicts a number from infinitely many possible numbers by making a best-fit function for all data points in the dataset to estimate the output. It approximates the relationship between inputs and outputs.

$$Training Set \rightarrow Learning Algorithm \rightarrow f(x)$$
$$x \rightarrow f(x) \rightarrow \hat{y}$$

Simple example of regression algorithm might be the model which predicts the price of the house by taking its size and age as inputs.
