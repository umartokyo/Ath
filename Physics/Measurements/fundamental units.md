Fundamental units: Defined only in terms with which they are measured.
Derived units: Can be expressed as algebraic combinations of fundamental units.
SI units: International Standard measurements, and are part of metric system.

There are four fundamental SI units of measurement: Second, Meter, Kilogram and Columb.
### Second (s)
- Was used to be measured as 1/86,400th of a mean solar day.
- Updated in 1967: Time required for Cesium atom to vibrate for 9,192,631,770 times.
### Meter (m)
- 1/10,000,000 of the distance between equator and North Pole. (1791)
- Distance between 2 engraved lines on a platinum iridium bar at Paris. (1889)
- 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. (1960)
- Distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second. (1983)
	- Speed of light: $299,792,458 m/s$
### Kilogram (kg)
- Mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder, kept with old meter standard at the International Bureau of weights and measures near Paris.
