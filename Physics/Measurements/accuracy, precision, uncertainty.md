Accuracy - How close the measurement is to the real value.
Precision - How close the agreement between measurements is.
Uncertainty - How much measurement deviate from expected value.
## Uncertainty
Uncertainty is often denoted as $\delta A$; result: $A+\delta A$
Factors affecting uncertainty:
- Limitations of the measuring device.
- Skill of the person making measurement.
- Irregularities in the object measured.
- Any other factors affecting outcome. (depends on the situation)
## Percent Uncertainty
Percent uncertainty formula:
$$ \%unc = \frac{\delta A}{A} \times 100\%$$
where $A$ is the expected value and $\delta A$ is the measurement.
- To calculate uncertainty of multiple values' multiplication or division, if the measurements have small uncertainties, we add uncertainties up.
## Precision of Measuring Tools + Significant Figures
- Significant figures indicate the precision of measuring tool used.
- To calculate number of significant figures, star with the first measured value at the left and come up to last digit on the right.
- Zeros are significant except when they serve as place keepers.
- When doing calculations with numbers of various significant figures, the final answer cannot have more significant figures than least precise measured value.
	- Multiplication and Division: Result should have same amount of sig.figs as the quantity having the last amount of sig.figs in calculations.
		- Example: $A=\pi r^2, r=1.2mm → A=(3.141592...)(1.2) → 4.523894...mm^2 → 4.5mm^2$
	- Addition and multiplication: Result can contain no more decilam places than teh least precise measurement.
		- Example: $7.56-6.052+13.7=15.208→15.2$
