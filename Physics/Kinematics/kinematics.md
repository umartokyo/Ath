Kinematics is a study of motion without considering its causes. The word comes from the Greek word 'kinesi', which means motion.

## 1D Kinematic Equations
SUVAT equations, aka equations of motions describe behavior of a physical system in terms of motion as a function of time. 
$$v=u+at$$
$$v^2=u^2+2as$$
$$s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$$
where $v=$ final velocity, $u=$ initial velocity, $s=$ displacement, $a=$ acceleration, $t=$ time.
