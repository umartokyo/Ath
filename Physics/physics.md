Word physics comes from a greek word 'physica', which means 'nature'. Physics, originally known as "natural philosophy", used to include whole realm of sciences, now divided into biology, chemistry, astrology, mathematics and physics. Now, physics is a study of matter, energy, space, time and their relationship. Physics as we know it today is divided into two categories: classical physics and modern physics. 
## Classical Physics vs Modern Physics
Classical Physics:
- Not an exact description of a universe.
- Great approximation under these conditions:
	- Matter moves slower than 1% of speed of light.
	- Object is large enough to be seen through microscope.
	- Only for weak gravitational fields.

Modern Physics:
- Consists of 2 main parts:
	- Relativity
	- Quantum Mechanics
- Mix of those 2 parts, thus called "Relativistic Quantum Mechanics".

- ! Knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics.
- ! R.Q.M's math is really complicated as it's used only when necessary.
