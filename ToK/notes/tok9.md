Does it matter that your personal circumstances influence how seriously your knowledge is taken?
Eventually, our goal is to put everyone into the same plane and take everyone's opinion as an equal. Where they come from, their personal circumstances does not matter; who they are the work they've done is what matters. 

Are there any groups of people whose claims you typically do not give legitimacy to? In what context, why?
- Flat Earth believers - Umarbek
- In American Military, if you're in an army, you're automatically assumed to be dumb - Ms.Phelps.
- Extremists, Neo-Nazi - Imron

Is it inevitable that a claim-maker's identity should affect our assessment of the legitimacy of their claim?

> Ethics: Moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.

Epistemic: big tree, where knowledge comes from.

When people experience things but they're not right.
Ms.Phelps hates people who backpack around the world because backpackers think they do so many good things, help locals, have such a wider world view and experiences so many things but they've just traveled. Although they did experience this, it isn't the truth, not the whole story.

In everything, there are 3 side: your side, their side, right side

Cross-Culturally:
- Dominant culture (decider of what counts as knowledge and what has legitimacy) (Ex: Nazi's) (majorit)
- Newcomers culture (may find their perspectives or claims dismissed not only because of their identity, but also because they simply have no idea what they are talking about.) (new idea to the dominant culture) (Ex: underground fighting Nazi's) (can both be right and wrong) (minority)

There's is a dominant idea / knowledge, from which people change their opinions to newcomers' idea / knowledge.

The very structure of collective knowledge can therefore be prejudicial.

Prejudicial: Harmful.
Prejudice: Biased

Umarbek: Flat Earth believers & Evolution
Gyuri: North Korea
Ms.Phelps: Military & government

What exactly is the role of the power in epistemic justice?

Is the extent to which power determines what counts as knowledge, even to affirm or deny the lived experiences of others?

WikiLeaks: publishes classified information even if it puts soldiers and other peoples lives at risk.

To what extent do the concepts that we use shape the conclusions that we reach?

What are our individual responsibilities towards epistemic justice, especially in cross-cultural contexts?
