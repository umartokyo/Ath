> Why do people believe strange things + what should we do about it?

- Gyuri: Her grandmother has a very conservative view on the world
- Ali: Her grandparents from mom's side are very religious. Growing up she couldn't watch harry potter, anything Mexican or so on.

To add to these challenged how does one continue to respect others' perspective when they dispute the facts 

Ms.Phelps: Is Taiwan part of China?
Richard: I think it's not. Historically it is but RPC not as one is republic and second one is communist... They have different opinions and so on. Mostly Taiwanese people do not want to be included into the China.
Brandon: When Messi came to China, he thought Taiwan was part of China and got stuck inthere because his passport was free to Taiwan but not to Chinese mainland.
Ms.Phelps: Does China have rights to take Taiwan back?
Richard: It cooould~~
Ms.Phelps: Do you believe China has moral right to make Taiwan to make a part of China again or leave it alone?
Richard, Brandon: They shouldn't make it part for a moral reasons. 

How does one react when these perspectives block political processes and policy decisions that one sees as essential to the common good?
- Negotiating common ground - Umarbek
- Communication, fight - Imron
- Asking questions - Ali\
Think of a filter as of something's perspective. You're looking at whatever was filtered out, their point of view and trying to find a good common ground.

We believe what we do, not because of acts, but because of how we think. 
An example of this is conspiracy theorists are described as gullible careless in reasoning, indifferent to authority and less able to discern between evidence and speculation, but to describe them as gullible (easily persuaded) or careless is not to describe their reasons, but their habits of mind. 
Calling them gullible or that they're not really thinking things through isn't exactly an ethical thing to do because of the amount of different kinds of opinions and outlooks they can have. 

> Speculation: Formation of a theory or conjecture without evidence.

Human behavior, at any given time, is contextual, explained by circumstances rather than habits or character traits. People who are hungry, upset or in a rush may act and think differently in a given situation than those who are relaxed. This is called the 'situationist' argument. 
Example: When you are arguing with your friend, you might say 'I hate you', which is not true as in general you like him, yet by looking at this exact situation only, others would say you hate him.
