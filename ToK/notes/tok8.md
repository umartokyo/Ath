## Intellectual Entitlement
In most legal systems today, we are protected from brainwashing, indoctrination and other forceful & intrusive means of belief-changing.
> Do we have a right to believe whatever we want?

As long as nobody is hurt, have fun believing something you don't believe.
We are generally not protected from having our beliefs scrutinized, questioned & criticized. Right often have limits & come with responsibilities.

Scrutinize: examining every detail.

As long as you can back it up, and have a courage and abilities to do so, you can technically do it. Would you agree, for example that we have a right to "believe responsibly?".
Believing responsibly: proving that you're an intelligent human being that can actually think for yourself. You've decided that whatever is happening, you're believing it responsibly because you've done the research, know it from past experience and so on.

A "right to believe" could be conceived from evidential (what you've seen) or from your morals or believes. A moral live to believe would be problematic if we consider the acts of questioning or criticizing someone's beliefs as depriving them of this right.

A right to believe should not be used negatively. 

> "It is wrong, always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence" - W.K.Clifford, University of London.

To what extent do you agree with this statement? Are there some beliefs that should be insulated from questioning? Should knowledge never be contestable?
- Insufficient evidence: Whenever there are no enough of reliable information supporting the evidence.
- I do believe this statement is correct in the most of the cases. 

Problematic Belief: Belief that targets, endangers, hurts someone. Inventing irrational numbers, drinking alcohol...

The claims that beliefs are influenced by peoples' upbringing, education, identities, and the situations they find themselves in is widely asserted & believed. One might laugh off or dismiss a friend's problematic beliefs. One is also more likely to excuse a child's ignorance of an adult stranger with opposing political views. It can sometimes be difficult to separate our judgement of a belief, especially with morally concerning beliefs. To what extent is this separation warranted, desirable or possible.

> "If the content of a belief is judged morally wrong, it is also thought to be false." - D.Denicola, "You don't have a right to believe whatever you want to." article.

Not all beliefs aspire to truth (not all beliefs are trying to be truth) - some may be useful beliefs, or coping beliefs, or pretty little lies. (Useful beliefs are not trying to be true, they're trying to be useful.)

You create a thought, think about using a knowledge framework, create a belief.

Do we have a responsibility to seek out understanding & protect different perspectives?

Nah, I'm not fighting in ww3.
Having multiple, partially overlapping, and sometimes contradictory perspectives coexisting in the same space presents advantages as well as challenges.

Having a personal and civic ethic that cultivates these advantages and manages the challenges is called **pluralism**, and is a foundation for modern liberal democracies around the world.

Pluralism is threatened when the appetite, or capacity, for managing these challenges are diminished, for example when efforts at consensus-building and respectful dialogue between opposing perspectives are seen as unimportant or not worth it.

1. Surrounding people who have the same values but different perspectives is important. Otherwise you're an idiot as you're not letting yourself grow. 
2. How important are other factors, such as autonomy + freedom, which afford these perspectives agency? 
3. What is lost when a perspective is lost?

"I want you to use those guys in the exhibition" - MsPhelps about flat and doughnut Earth people.

To what extent is it possible to separate the claim from the claim-maker?

I bought Tesla. I had to very much forget the fact I was like give me that money because Tesla was a good let's see it kind of doesn't she racist drivers license OK so you need to learn you need to understand how to separate who made it and what they need to understand how to look at who made it and does that make what they made viable they made ethical or how did they make it? These are two separate things that you have to look at is not just one thing so it's not just who made it and then the actual we separate the man look at marks and communism, we look at I can't think of Greek guys democracy both of them both of those people both of those main governmental systems issues and both of those systems have issues. Both of those systems rely on people not being people people being when the people that made them themselves were not perfect, but they were reliable because they knew what they're talking about just because they're talking about does not mean reliable and vice versa. You have to be able to look at them and be able to separate.

Does it matter that your personal circumstance influence how seriously your knowledge is taken? Personal circumstances is very came from or like very. It affects how serious serious other people personal life that's a point of knowledge right like if some PD is talking about something and right now I'm talking about something PD person would probably have more authority and more seriousness in here than all she is giving us I'm going through something on Thursday because I have a couple things to this is exhibition a week from Monday.
