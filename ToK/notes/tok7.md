Tools and methods is all about how people come up with conclusions. We have to look within viewpoints of other thinkers and see where they've gotten their knowledge from.

> Your habits determine who you are and what what you do. - Ms.Phelps

Why do people believe in strange things and what should we do about it.

Examining your habits of thinking is understanding how you have acquired particular habits and not others. Take ownership and responsibility for your habits developed, not fixed, and therefore can be improved upon. As you're the one who've developed your habits, it's your responsibility to repeating, reflecting and changing them.

You have to look to see the consequences of your habits and how it affects others and outer world same as yourself.
