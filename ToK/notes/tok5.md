- Do you believe that individuals have a responsibility to be knowledgeable about the world?
- If not, what motivates you in your pursuit of knowledge?
	Its your responsibility to seek for knowledge to use the knowledge you have for the greater good to build a better world as you're the one who got lucky with your parents, getting a good education... It's your responsibility to do something about it.

Is knowledge contestable / debatable?
	It can be like debatable, for example in scientific journals.
	Gyuri: Yes; cause everyone has different knowledge.
	Ali: One might be expert and second isn't. Opinion-based knowledge is very much contestable.
	Keep open the possibility of more than one correct, legitimate or good answer to any question you explore.
	Four powerful motivators are: curiosity, wonder, yearning for meaning and purpose.

If experts are divided and we are not experts, who do we trust?

This AoK part is important as it helps us understand whom we should and should not listen to.

How we think about expertise if influenced by the opinions of experts that we already trust; this seemingly innocuous knowledge claim has profound implications, suggesting that your history and context, over which you may have had little control, influence your orientation to new knowledge generally, and expertise specifically.

The further implication is that to know something you must also know yourself.

Everything you know worked or changed by the people who know more, but you need to decide who knows the most.
### Reflection
Consider the ways in which your knowledge has been influenced by what experts think and say?
1. How important have experts been for knowledge you have gained?
	Experts are the main source of information in my interest of ML, as they've been sharing their knowledge with others which they've gained through experiments requiring high investments both financial and time-wise.
2. Do you regularly refer to expert knowledge for the claims you make?
	Yes. Top researchers have way more knowledge, experience and time which they've dedicated for search of knowledge, which they've shared, and it is the most reliable source of information.
3. Recall a situation when you have encountered contradicting expert opinions. How did you decide whom to trust?
	There was a case where two researchers were debating whenever one of two implementation methods of algorithm was better than the other one, and I've sticked to the expert with more evidence of being correct.
You may not be the expert in the group but you can be more knowledgable then the group.

When are differences of belief and differences widespread?
	In more controversial and personal topics as Religion or personal preferences.

What makes you trust your current perspective?
	Source, if its backed up by other knowledge of ours, if there are others agreeing to it, if you thoughts about ti enough.

What is trust:
	Gyuri: You believe in that person within reason.
	Umarbek: Confidence, certainty in rightness, correctness.

What makes you trust in your opinion on homework:
	Gyuri: Your perspectives.
	Imron: Other victim's perspectives.

Why do people believe in weird things:
	Umarbek: They want to believe + if it does not harm then why not leave it there? (Alien example)

Cherry Picking
	Person seeks for evidence justifying only their opinions and beliefs while ignoring any contradictions.
