Knowledge is complicated by power and authority, some knowledge and knowledges maybe more persuasive than others. Anyone who is an authority in your life can change your knowledge. "You're the average of people you talk to." 

What influences whether we trust and have confidence in a given claim?
-  Reliable knowledge we've collected through past experiences.
- If the claim belongs to the area of our focus.

Is there a difference between trust and confidence?
- In this scenario, I believe these two words could be used interchangeably.
- Thinking further, there could be way to separate them:
	- Trust: 
		- Is more truthful. We can give and take trust. - Umar, Umarbek
		- When you're ambiguous of whether it's right or wrong but want to be confident in it. (based on relationship) - Gyuri, Sumire
		- Truth is based in part on faith - Imron, Seojin
	- Confidence: 
		- Linked to evidence. We might feel confident when we're certain about the reliability of the thing. - Umar, Umarbek
		- When you truly feel like the claim is right. (based on your prior knowledge) - Gyuri, Sumire
		- Is the trust you have in something from past / experiences and expectations you have in something. - Imron, Seojin

	For the exhibition, you need to trust in yourself and confidence in what you're doing.

Knowledge is organized in a certain way, with institutions, structures and conventions. (as dividing into subjects at school, chapter in book, science, folk, religion)
Q: To what extent are these domains natural or contrived?
Q: Why do they exist separately from one another?
A: Humans are creatures who love classification and abstraction. Their amazing skills of taking a broad subject of "life" is divided into more specific principles like sciences, communication, basics... they are divided into sub-topics and so on and so on. 
A: Idea based knowledge vs. physical knowledge. It's all the matter of how you get it and what you do with it.

What are dragons on the maps?
- They might be storms! Areas of past casualties.

Think of what you want to be when you grow up, and think of everything you have to do to achieve it.
Are there things stopping you from learning things? (you have to go to uni, or good get course?) If you were raised in a very a family you might have dragons, obstacle in learning b.

When you'll be exploring knowledge questions, you need to look at them from three different AoK's.
	Can we say there are predictable limits to knowledge in the sciences, the arts, or mathematics?

Class discussion: The limits of knowledge
1. What factors limit our knowledge in the different domains, such as science, arts, + history?
	- Compute (Time + Brainpower)
2. To what extent do the different areas of knowledge cover the range of what there is to know?
	- Humans as classification-based creatures have divided the universe into parts, sub-parts, sub-sub-parts and so on, and areas of knowledge are comprehensive sub-sections of the knowledge of the universe.
3. How have humans overcome the limits to the knowledge in the past?
	- Humans are continuously discovering new technologies and overcoming the limits to the knowledge of the past?
4. Could you definitely say something is beyond our collective scope of knowledge? How would you know this?
	- There is nothing beyond our collective scope of knowledge. Give us compute and we'll figure everything out.

a) Does knowledge in religion extend to where scientific knowledge cannot?
	Religion explores unexplored, spiritual things which science does not.
b) Does art take over from mathematics at some point?
	None of these two can take over the second because they are different disciplines yet they can mix and help each other.

Conversation
	Ms.Phelps: Who decides if a mathematical formula is correct?
	Everyone: Experts decide on it.
	Umarbek: There are no experts, you can only prove it.
	Ali: Thats why humans don't like mathematics.

Conversation
	Ms.Phelps: Is this art? "holding an emergency helmet"
	Umarbek: Sure. But how valuable it is?

	“Put simply, people tend to do what they know and fail to do that which they have no ception of in that way, ignorance profoundly channels the course we take in life” 
	-David Dunning 2010

Quote 2
	“Knowledge is a big subject. Ignorance is bigger. And it is more interesting.”
