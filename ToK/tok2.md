## The Core Theme in Theory of Knowledge
As we live and learn more, we gain knowledge from others, our experience and ecological contexts.
	"This foundation influences how we encounter new knowledge and different perspectives, and shows up in the stories of others"

	Something that makes you being aware of other that self.
	In large scope, you actually care and know what's going on.
