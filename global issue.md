3 Requirements:
1. Significant
2. Transnational
3. Relevant to everyday life

Easiest formula for global issue:
[Problem/Cause] + [Effect/Possible Solution]
Example:
	[The limits of law and justice can exacerbate crimes against humanity,] + [which violate human rights and affect people beyond the events.]
Try not to repeat yourself in global issue.

More examples:
- How communal inequality lead to social unrest.
- How self-hatred can be the result of discrimination.
- How globalization has created a struggle for identity.
Notice how each contain a 'noun-phrase', (inequality, unrest) and it's connected to other word.

Layers of Abstraction:
	Concrete thing is a solid idea and abstract thing is the outcome, your interpretation of it.
	We can get from Michael Brown - Ferguson - Racial profiling - Black lives matter - Racial Profiling - Racism - Discrimination - Injustice, and we could go into so many more different places than Injustice.
