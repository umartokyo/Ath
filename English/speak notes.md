Scarlet Woman
	The story takes place in puritan England, where she has an affair and has a kid. The society decides that she has to wear a red A. (like in 'easy A' movie) She takes the whole thing in a lot of pride and wears the red letter believing that everyone is wrong.

Rachelle (p102, Speak)
	"I thought we were supposed to have opinions here. My opinion is that it's kind of hard to read, but the part about how Hester gets in trouble and the preacher guy almost gets away with it, well, that's a good story. But I think you are making all this symbolism stuff up. I don't believe any of it."
Here, Rachelle says the story is about a guy raping a girl who is main character's friend and getting away with it is good, which is ironically nearly identical to what situation she is creating.

- When you go through some traumatic event, you remember environment and then you remember a person
- The whole story is connected to trees, as it is the place where she was raped, "under the tree".

- Here, idea goes from "i need a therapist, there's something wrong with me", to the "i can fly". This is where she *spoke* and people listened.
- "**#me too**" is a campaign where woman who are victim of rape were able to share their traumatic experiences throughout internet. 
- When she wrote Andy's name on the bathroom, this was the way how she *spoke* and which helped her to understand herself and fight Andy later on.

PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
Your brain is trying to handle whatever 

When you're a victim of sexual assault, it sometimes takes decades to open up and share it to others. MeToo movement was created for community to know that there are others who've experienced the same thing and now it has become something to raise awareness about the topic. MeToo became a big thing because Harvey Weinstein was who every woman of holly-wood came after as he was using his position to threaten careers of actresses to have sex with him.

Sexual assault is serious but level of it varies. It can vary from something which completely destroys your life and you might suicide or mess with your head a little or something. In Africa, if somebody sexually assaults you, you'll have to marry that person as he/she took your virginity. 

Note how its 43% men, and Ms.Phelps states that almost all of it happens when they were young. 
Suburbia, location where Melinda lives, which is common place to be sexually assaulted and men to get away from it because people think everything and everyone is perfect in suburbia. 

Impact of social media in MeToo movement is significant. It helped to create a community and raise an awareness concerning the topic. The fact that even such small actress Alyssa Milano blew this topic up in 48 hours, shows how important the topic is.
