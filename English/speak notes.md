Scarlet Woman
	The story takes place in puritan England, where she has an affair and has a kid. The society decides that she has to wear a red A. (like in 'easy A' movie) She takes the whole thing in a lot of pride and wears the red letter believing that everyone is wrong.

Rachelle (p102, Speak)
	"I thought we were supposed to have opinions here. My opinion is that it's kind of hard to read, but the part about how Hester gets in trouble and the preacher guy almost gets away with it, well, that's a good story. But I think you are making all this symbolism stuff up. I don't believe any of it."
Here, Rachelle says the story is about a guy raping a girl who is main character's friend and getting away with it is good, which is ironically nearly identical to what situation she is creating.

- When you go through some traumatic event, you remember environment and then you remember a person
- The whole story is connected to trees, as it is the place where she was raped, "under the tree".
Page 184-186, Chat Room
- Here, idea goes from "i need a therapist, there's something wrong with me", to the "i can fly". This is where she *spoke* and people listened.
- "**#me too**" is a campaign where woman who are victim of rape were able to share their traumatic experiences throughout internet. 
- When she wrote Andy's name on the bathroom, this was the way how she *spoke* and which helped her to understand herself and fight Andy later on.

PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
Your brain is trying to handle whatever 

When you're a victim of sexual assault, it sometimes takes decades to open up and share it to others. MeToo movement was created for community to know that there are others who've experienced the same thing and now it has become something to raise awareness about the topic. MeToo became a big thing because Harvey Weinstein was who every woman of holly-wood came after as he was using his position to threaten careers of actresses to have sex with him.

Sexual assault is serious but level of it varies. It can vary from something which completely destroys your life and you might suicide or mess with your head a little or something. In Africa, if somebody sexually assaults you, you'll have to marry that person as he/she took your virginity. 

Note how its 43% men, and Ms.Phelps states that almost all of it happens when they were young. 
Suburbia, location where Melinda lives, which is common place to be sexually assaulted and men to get away from it because people think everything and everyone is perfect in suburbia. 

Impact of social media in MeToo movement is significant. It helped to create a community and raise an awareness concerning the topic. The fact that even such small actress Alyssa Milano blew this topic up in 48 hours, shows how important the topic is.
## Sep 2
Women who resolve domestic violence are 80 percent less prone for this but when this happens in workplace, outside then MeToo is what happens. I will be constantly asking if something still happens. Whenever you watch red carpet things, people always ask women of what they are wearing and what they are wearing and if anything wrong with it, then something happens with her while men just come in suits. There isn't a place on the internet which is 100% innocent. If a man is accused of something it's guilty if not proven wrong. A single kid can destroy teacher's life by just saying something bad about him, and it will bring severe damage to teacher's reputation. Guilty until proven innocent. If some male was accused of it, it will follow him 'till the end of his life and afterwards.

How can the meaning of a text be constructed, negotiated, expressed or interpreted by readers & writers? Using two literary text you have studied describe how a readers & writers are shown a text's meaning. 
	All AOE questions are paper 2 questions reworded a bit. - Ms.Phelps

Paper 2 is the hardest what we'll do in the future so that's why most of the things we're doing will be a cheat-sheet for paper 2. We were able to dissect a question by breaking it down into sections and have created an answer to paper 2 question without even knowing it.

**Toxic Masculinity**
Toxic Masculinity: 
- "Being jacked". Competing over being more muscular and man is called so. 
- Masculinity: Qualities or attributes regarded as characteristic of men or boys.
- A collection of offensive, harmful beliefs tendencies, and behaviours rooted in traditional male roles but taken to an extreme. This dangerous idea of "manliness" perpetuates domination, homophobia, and aggression and can be harmful to the mental health of all genders.
- Physical aggression is a socially constructed gendered behavior embedded in the social meanings of masculinities across many cultures. The general unwillingness of people to recognize that violence is a men's issue is also reflected in general society.
- As an excuse of something being stupid is "boys will be boys" but there's no phrase as "girls will be girls" - Ms.Phelps
- Because of toxic masculinity, we have the issues within speak. Andy wouldn't rape Melinda, Mr.Neck would be acting more humane. Toxic masculinity is a catalyst of Melinda's mental issues.
