****Students will create a Public Safety Announcement concerning an issue that would cause woman to feel that had no voice to defend themselves or have their side heard.****
This can be completed in many formats such as:
-30 second advert clip
-Informational poster
-Website
-Public Art
*Have all formats approved*

Extra:
- Our PSA must have some kind of infographic on it. 
- We can't use me_too or other examples used by Ms.Phelps. 
- Sexual assault is not the only topic of use. We can also use different topics like body-shaming, social expectations of women's bodies, domestic violence, partner violence, manipulation (common for girls to be used by guys especially when they're close friends like grooming (when you brainwash them into thinking what you're doing is okay but its not)), catcalling.
