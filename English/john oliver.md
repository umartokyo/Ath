Satire: making fun of society.
Bill Clinton was kicked out from his presidency when he've lied under an oath that he haven't slept with Monica Lewinsky. In the Starr report, you can read through all the horrible aspects of this affair. Up to this day, nobody mention's Bill's affair and he got away with having an affair with 22 year old very easily as he got all the power.

Public Shaming and John Oliver; Saturday Night

The worst aunt ever got hurt in her nephew's property. There's a thing called home insurance, which would cover up expenses of the thing happened within the property. To get the money for the medical bills, she sued her nephew. Nobody in her family blinked an eye on this, yet most likely her brother or sister helped to fill the paperwork. 

Would the situation change if it would be uncle instead of aunt?
	I think the thing went viral because of her position in the family rather than her being a woman.

> "The media in general goes after woman." - Ms.Phelps

Often, with this medical thing, nurses sell these stories to the news agencies. You'll find much more stories about mothers being abusive rather than fathers being abusive. It becomes the mom thing. This is Ms.Phelps's opinion. Every single word form Monica Lewinsky suggests she've changed her name (personality) even though she hasn't done it officially.

Unconscious / ingrained: habit, belief, or attitude firmly established, difficult to change.

> "As feminism develops, society unconsciously develops on woman." - global issue from Gyuri

Patriarchy / Matriarchy

Golden rule: treat other people as you want to be treated.

Global Issue out of :
	Ignorance of the details of the person's reasons leads to risk of misjudgment of their actions.

Outrage Machine: Whenever people find bits of the story, focus on it, and ruin someone's life with it. "Goldfish" effect, shortens the attention span, encouraging click-bait culture and people get inundated by not always helpful information. John Oliver is saying how outrage machine opened up endless possibilities for public shaming. Internet is erasing accountability from people. Except Linus's failed framework experiment, MeToo movement is also an example of public shaming. 

> "Viral" & "Shame" would be good to have in your global issue.

Note what he says about what his team choses to and not to talk about. Punishment can be vastly disproportionate to the events. Patient zero: the very first one. The consequences of misdirected anger. 

Ms.Phelps was 11 or 12 when Lewinsky accident have happened. 
Exasperated - gotten worse. 

Just remember how all the public shaming went into Monika's way, but no one have blamed Bill Clinton, the president of US for anything.
