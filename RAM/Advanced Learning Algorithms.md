## Neural Networks
We will study
- Inference - prediction
- Training
- Practical advices for building machine learning systems
- Decision Trees
## Neurons
Artificial Neural networks = Neural Networks

Origins: Algorithms that try to mimic the brain
Used in the 1980's and early 1990's/
Fell out of favor in the late 1990's
Resurgence from around 2005.
Speech -> Images -> text (NLP) -> everything
## Demand Prediction - looking at a product to predict if it will be a top seller or not.
Simple example of demand prediction would a logistic regression with sigmoid function. It would take an input and return a probability. Function $f(x)$ would be called "activation" and be denoted with $a$. so what we have is input x -> neuron 0> probability a of t-short being top seller.
