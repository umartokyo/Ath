### Scarlet Woman
The story takes place in puritan England, where she has an affair and has a kid. The society decides that she has to wear a red A. (like in 'easy A' movie) She takes the whole thing in a lot of pride and wears the red letter believing that everyone is wrong.

Rachelle (p102, Speak)
	"I thought we were supposed to have opinions here. My opinion is that it's kind of hard to read, but the part about how Hester gets in trouble and the preacher guy almost gets away with it, well, that's a good story. But I think you are making all this symbolism stuff up. I don't believe any of it."
Here, Rachelle says the story is about a guy raping a girl who is main character's friend and getting away with it is good, which is ironically nearly identical to what situation she is creating.

- "#me too" is a campaign where woman who are victim of rape were able to share their traumatic experiences throughout internet. 
- When she wrote Andy's name on the bathroom, this was the way how she *spoke* and which helped her to understand herself and fight Andy later on.
