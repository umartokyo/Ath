Modern version of 'Software as a Service' (SaaS) is often referred to as 'Cloud-Native Services'. They are designed specifically for cloud environments, leveraging cloud computing's scalability, flexibility, and distributed architecture. 

- traditional SaaS → server fails = can't do anything
- cloud-native application → serverless → can continue to use
- SaaS example: Salesforce, Dropbox, Zen disk
- Cloud example: Spotify, Netflix, Zoom
