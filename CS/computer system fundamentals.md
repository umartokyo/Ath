## Systems in organizations
**Context**: environment, condition, needs
**Stakeholder**: anyone who is relevant in the process
	define problem / opportunity
### System Life Cycle
- Initial concept to eventual retirement.
- Used to ensure that a system meets required needs and effectively managed through its life cycle.
- Software & System engineering
### Extents & Limitations
**Extent**: Defined capabilities, what it can do? (functionalities, problems to solve, user needs)
**Limitation**: Constrains. (scalability, applicability, performance, technical, financial)
### Organizational Issues
- **Change management**: Managing resistance to change. (training to use new system)
- **Training & Support**: Providing adequate resources and ongoing support.
- **Resource allocation**: allocating sufficient resources, including time, budget, personnel.
- **Integration with existing systems:** Ensuring the new system integrates smoothly with existing systems.
- **Communications**: Maintaining clear communication throughout. (frequent communication with client is necessary)

Case:
	UK NHS (health) → Lorenzo system → centralize patient records
	Issue: integration & user adaption
	Administration: telephone numbers, emergency contact
### Feasibility study / report
New system in Japan to enhance urban traffic using AI powered traffic signals.
- Takes time to integrate, legal concerns for data protection.
TELOS:
T: Technical feasibility; is the existing technology sufficient?
E: Economic feasibility; is it cost effective?
L: Legal feasibility; are there any conflicts with legal systems? is it ethical?
O: Operational feasibility; existing operational systems to support maintenance?
S: Schedule feasibility; existing operational systems to support maintenance?

HW: [[CS Flashcards]]
## Need for change management
Social / Ethical issue:
- Structured approach to transition groups to desired future state
- Managing human side → addressing resistance

Case:
	New customer relationship management system (CRM system) → concerned sales team adaptation with no time for training so they just give out manuals for self-study at home. (very bad idea)
## Compatibility Issues
**Compatibility**:  The ability of different systems, devices, components to work together effectively without conflicts or issues.
- hardware and software applications can operate seamlessly with each other
- so that various elements within a system can interact and perform as intended
- example: bank account →wider range of audience (customer satisfaction)

**Legacy Systems**:
- an older computer system that remains in use despite being outdated
- can pose challenges for integration, security and scalability but sometimes retained due to high cost or complexity of transitioning to the new systems.

**Business Mergers**:
- international dimension & social / ethical issue
- def: strategic process where two companies combine to form a single entity
- goals: expanding market reach, increasing operational efficiency, enhancing competitive advantage
- integrate resources, operations cultures → aligning business strategies, systems, personnel
