# Ath:  Collaborative Notebook
Welcome to Ath, a community-driven knowledge sharing platform for curious minds who like to explore, learn, share knowledge and invent new things. 

Ath is an open-source repository designed to be a collaborative notebook where geeks can share their knowledge, insights, and passion projects. Our goal is to create a diverse, high-quality collection of notes, articles, insights, passion projects on tech and other topics.

## How It Works ü§î
- **GitHUB Repository**: Ath lives on Github, leveraging ease of use, version control, collaborative editing and other features.
- **Markdown Files**: All main contents are written in Markdown format  (.md) for easy editing and viewing. 
- **Obsidian**: While it's not required, we recommend using Obsidian to view the repository locally, which enables powerful features like backlinks, plugins and graph view.
